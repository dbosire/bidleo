                                        <p> 7.1. Auctions on Our Website follow a very simple structure and in order to provide You with the knowledge required to apply skill and judgement in the Auctions, We provide You with the following data for each and every Auction on Our Website:

7.2. RRP: this information is provided to the best of Our knowledge where relevant and is usually provided by the manufacturer of each Item. We cannot guarantee that the RRP is correct but will always use Our best endeavours to ensure that the RRP listed is as accurate as possible.

7.3. The Bid Entry Fee: this is the amount it will cost You, via Mpesa Paybill, to place a Bid for the Item. The Bid Entry Fee may vary depending on the Auction, so check this amount prior to placing each Bid to ensure that You are comfortable with the Bid Entry Fee.

7.4. A Unique Bid is deemed to be a Bid that is the only Bid placed for a specific amount within a specific Auction. If a further Bid is placed by another User for the exact same amount, then both Bids are deemed to be no longer Unique (i.e. they both become Non-Unique Bids).

7.5. In the event that there is no unique bid, i.e. all bids ranging from the lowest Ksh1 up to the highest bid have two or more bids placed, the successful bid shall be the first in time to place the bid that is the lowest with the least number of bids placed on it.

7.6. Auction close: in the case of a fixed time Auction, the auction closes when the time allocated to the auction shall have expired. In these fixed time Auctions, the auction is initially created by Us with a defined amount of time, e.g. 24 hours, one week, etc. The time may vary from auction to auction. In addition how BIDLEO also offer auctions that can end at any time at the discretion of the auctioneer. The type of auction is clearly displayed on the website and in the media and advertising for any given auction.

7.7. Upon completion of an Auction, the Successful Bidder will receive confirmation of their success by SMS.

7.8. We reserve the right to:

Â· Suspend or terminate an Auction at any time in the event of technical problems or to investigate suspected irregular or fraudulent activity;

    Limit the Auctions that You may participate in;

Â· Remove an auction if we feel it does not benefit our users and has not had sufficient interest. In this case all bids will be recredited to the userâ€™s accounts who placed bids.

7.9. Further information about how the Auctions work in a simpler guide can be found in the How It Works sections of Our Website.

7.10. For the avoidance of doubt, any advice or help articles appearing on Our Website are intended solely as suggestions for techniques and should not be construed as providing a solution to becoming the successful bidder in any specific Auction. We accept no liability whatsoever for any actions taken by a User as a result of reading, or being informed about, any of the advice or written materials available on Our Website.

7.11. The Successful Bidder will pay BIDLEO their bid amount. How Low, at its sole discretion may waive the requirement to pay by the bidder in ( Name for testimonial) of testimonials and other marketing material supplied by the successful bidder.

7.12 Wallet Account:
You may additionally bid using funds in your wallet by sending your bid by SMS to 40452. A wallet account is automatically created with BIDLEO once a bidder sends money to How Low via paybill. Any price paid above the official entry fee for any auction is held in your wallet. You may also deposit money into your wallet by sending money to our paybills with:

- the word DEPOSIT in the account field

- with an empty account field

- an invalid entry in the account field.

You can then use your wallet by sending your bid by SMS to 40452. If you want to check the balance on your wallet, text BAL to 40452. A wallet account handling fee of Ksh100 is charged per month from the date of registration for this service in any month that there is a balance held. You can cash out your wallet at any time by calling our customer service team. A one month grace period shall apply before the application of the wallet account handling fee.

7.13: Default auction and keywords:
Each BIDLEO auction has a unique keyword that must be included by the bidder in the account name field of Mpesa together with the bid amount, or included in the body of the text message when bidding via SMS. At any given time, there is a default auction where bid entries lacking a keyword as outlined above will be entered. The default auction at any time is chosen by BIDLEO and will be indicated as such on the website. Bidding using unrecognised keywords, i.e. keywords that do not exactly match those communicated on the website for the various auction listings will lead to those bids being entered into the current default auction. BIDLEO accepts no liability for any mistakes made by bidders who do not follow the clear instructions provided herein and on the website and enter incorrect information into the account field or SMS when bidding.

7.14. Bid Increments: Bids are accepted in full shillings only. Cents, decimals or fractions thereof will be discarded and only the integer shilling amount will be accepted as a bid. How Low do not perform any rounding, up or down, on bids using cents, decimals or fractions, and bids including the same may at How Lowâ€™s discretion be accepted or denied.</p>
